#Problem 1

First, I begin by loading the data set.

```{r introduce instacart data frame}
data("instacart")
instacart = as_tibble(instacart)
```

The data set _instacart_ has `r nrow(instacart)` rows and `r ncol(instacart)` columns. The data set lists items ordered by customers in a long format, with each item getting its own row. Key variables include order_number, aisle_id, department_id, and variables related to the time of the order.

There are `r instacart %>% select(aisle_id) %>% distinct %>% count` aisles. To find which aisles the most items are from, I will build a list of the aisles in order of most items to fewest items.

```{r}
instacart %>% 
  count(aisle) %>% 
  arrange(desc(n))
```

Based on this table, the most items are ordered from the fresh produce aisles. 

Let's look solely at aisles with more than 10,000 items ordered.



## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
